# ASHEMS-UI
A JavaFX user interface written for a Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen. The UI is part of the ECE capstone project at the University of Western Ontario (2019).

A "Smart" Home Energy Management System (ASHEMS) is a device that provides the user with insightful recommendations on power savings. The recommendations are generated based on the user behaviour and is part of the backend system not featured in this repository.

## Samples of the UI:
1. The home page. The consumption graph provides the user with historical data as well as a suggested usage limit at different times of the day. Right below the graph is a list of suggestions that tell the user how much they can save in a year and how difficult of a task it can be. On the right are a few widgets that can expand the intended use of the device.

2. The devices menu lists all of the devices connected to the network. On the right of the screen is a pie chart that displays the usage of the top most active devices. The pie chart helps the user visually understand just how much 3.7 kWh is compared to the total household consumption.

3. Each device displays its current and historical consumption as well as the current status (on/off).
